// Basic logging to the console with various input types.

// This command is used to display information in the console.
console.log("Hello world")

// A new line character is written as a '\n'
console.log("First line\nSecond line")

// Strings can also be broken up and concatenated.
console.log("This " + "is " + "one " + "sentence")

// Comments like these are marked with double forward slashes.
// It can also be used for integers or equations. Eg:
console.log(42)

console.log(20 / 5)

console.log( (10 * 5) / 2)

//Using the typeof operator, we can check what type of value was given
console.log(typeof 42)
// This will produce "number"
console.log(typeof "Hello")
// This will produce "String"
